# TS-TO-GQL
A tiny library to convert typescript interface into GraphQL schemas

NB: This is the most minimal version of the library.

## Folder Structure
The repository consists of two folders.
1. The src/lib folder consisting of the library implmentation.
2. The src/usage folder consisting a usage of the library usign Apollo

The library leveraged the Typescript compiler API to find the nodes in the typescript file and extract the required details as we want.
